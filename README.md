# Price-Range-of-london-AirBnb
The Repository contains 2 files :
1. The London AirBnb pdf ( which is the presentation of the total project)
2. The London AirBnb jupyter nb (which is the code used in finding solution of our research question)

Also this is my first project on GitHub , hence it might not be perfect but I do enjoy the platform and am learning it.
